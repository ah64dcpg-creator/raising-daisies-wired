# Raising Daisies – Wired Bundle (Front + Easy Connect)

This repo is built to be **as easy as possible**:
- Deploy frontend to **Vercel** (two taps)
- Paste your backend URL on the **/connect** page (from your iPhone)
- Optional: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` so it’s pre-wired automatically

## Quick steps (like I'm 10)
1) Push this folder to GitHub.
2) In **Vercel → New Project → Import**, set **Root Directory** to `oneclick/` → **Deploy**.
3) Open your Vercel URL on your iPhone:
   - If it shows “Not connected”, tap **Connect** and paste your backend URL (from Railway).
   - Or skip that if you already set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` in Vercel.
4) Add to Home Screen: **Share → Add to Home Screen**.

### Where do I get the backend URL?
Use the backend you deployed (e.g., Railway). It looks like:  
`https://your-backend.up.railway.app`

You can deploy a ready-made backend with auto-updates from Google Sheets (CSV). Ask me if you want that guide again.
